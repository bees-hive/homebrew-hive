    The final step after Elegant Git installation is to run
        git elegant acquire-repository
    for each git repository where Elegant Git is going to be used.

    If this step is not completed, Elegant Git may behave unexpectedly
    since the desired Git configuration (relevant for the current version)
    is not applied.
